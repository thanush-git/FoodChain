        <h1>What we do</h1>
        <p>FoodChain is a platform designed to reduce food waste and ensure excess food from events, restaurants, and
            households reaches those in need. By leveraging AI and blockchain technology, we create a seamless
            connection between food donors and nearby shelters, food banks, and charities.</p>

        <p>Our AI-powered system matches available food with the closest recipients in real-time, ensuring that
            donations are used efficiently and distributed while still fresh. Meanwhile, our blockchain technology
            guarantees full traceability and transparency, so donors and recipients alike can trust the process from
            start to finish.</p>

        <p> Whether youâ€™re hosting a large event or have excess food at home, FoodChain helps you turn potential waste
            into meaningful contributions, feeding communities while promoting sustainability.
